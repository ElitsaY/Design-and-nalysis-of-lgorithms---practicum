# Blueprint for every needed graph algorithm in this courses

Input format of the graph:
The first line contains two space separated integers **N** and **M** - the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges.
The next **M** lines contains two space separate integers $U_{i} V_{i}$ indicating there is an undirected edge between $U_{i}$ and $V_{i}$
